# Xam.Form.ScrollControl

Thanks to the awesome : https://github.com/sthewissen/KickassUI.Spotify by sthewissen I found exactly what I needed. A smooth implication of listview, well, in this case a scrollview, to act as a horizontal list.

I also added for it to work on UWP as per the requirements I was working with in a project.
